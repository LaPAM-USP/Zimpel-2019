The snp_marker.py algorithm takes as input two files:

1 - A file in a txt format containing the name of the strain and the associated cluster separated by a tab.
2 - A multifasta file containing the snps of each strain.

Running snp_marker:

Open Terminal in a directory containing the algorithm and the input files and enter the following command:

python3 snp_marker.py

The generated output is a table containing the cluster, snp and position of the snp in the fasta file.
